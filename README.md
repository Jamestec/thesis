# Thesis
This version is what was used for the final Thesis demo. The code has not been cleaned up and files not organised. The cleaned up version should be on the master branch.

The purpose of this branch is for reference if my cleaned up version does not work.

Note that references to bitstreams are absolute, therefore the bitstreams folder should be copied to '/home/ubuntu/bitstreams' on the ZedBoard's SD card to copy my environment.

An exact clone of the ZedBoard SD card used in the demo is available here:

The SD card used was a SanDisk Extreme PRO 64GB U3 A2 microSD and it was cloned using macOS's Disk Utility app (https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/comm/Mac+OS+-+Make+a+Backup+Copy+of+Your+SD+Card).

It can be restored to a SD card by following these instructions:
