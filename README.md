# Thesis
This version is what was used for the final Thesis demo. The code has not been cleaned up and files not organised. The cleaned up version should be on the master branch.

The purpose of this branch is for reference if my cleaned up version does not work.

Note that references to bitstreams are absolute, therefore the bitstreams folder should be copied to '/home/ubuntu/bitstreams' on the ZedBoard's SD card to copy my environment.
